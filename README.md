Login
If you do not have a login, head over to the register tab. If you have already registered, type in username and password, then log in.
If the username doesn't exist, or the password is wrong, or any other problem arises, an apology page will display. Just go back in your browser to return
to login.

Register
In the register page, type in a new, unique username, and type in a password and its confirmation. For any action that doesn't follow those instructions,
an apology will show. After registering, you will be brought to the index page.

Index
The index page update every time you visit it. Click on "PROGREE" to get back to it. For a new user, everything will be empty, and all the Gen Eds will be in the "To Be Completed"
section. As you add classes, the progress bars will update, and Gen Eds may be moved over to the completed section. Each of the progress bars
are pretty self-explanatory, but I will explain how I calculated them in my design document.

Add Class
The Add Class tab works like Mashup. Type in a full class name or number ("Introduction to Computer Science I" or "COMPSCI50", note that "CS50" won't work
since it doesn't show up in the courses50 database), and wait for the drop down to appear, it could be very quick or take 5-10 seconds depending on the search.
Once you click a class to add, an alert will say 'Class added!', and you will know you added a class. Repeat this process to add mulitple classes.

Remove Class
The Remove Class tab will display a drop down of all your classes, select one you want to remove and click remove to do so.

Search Classes
The Search Class tab will ask for the name or number of a class, and after hitting Search, will show a table with all of the matches for that criteria,
so a user can browse all of the classes before adding one.

Class List
Class List displays the number and name of all the classes that the user is currently in.

Change Password
Change Password asks for the old password, and requires a new password to match its confirmation before changing the password.
